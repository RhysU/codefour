This Fortran 90 code solves inviscid or viscid 1D scalar conservation laws of
the form u_t + f(u)_x = 0 or u_t + f(u)_x = \nu u_{xx} using WENO
reconstruction and a Lax-Friedrichs flux.

It is based heavily on one provided through Caltech's AE 232 course
(http://www.its.caltech.edu/~appelo/ae232/).  Compared to the course,
the following changes have been made:

  1) Adding 3rd-order WENO reconstruction
  2) Adding 2nd and 4th order viscous capabilities
  3) Adding HDF5-based result output
  4) Adding Doxygen-based documentation
  5) Adding Mathematica-based error analysis against Hopf-Cole-based
     analytic solutions of the viscid Burger's equation.
